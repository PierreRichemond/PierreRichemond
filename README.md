### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have starting coding in early June 2021, it's been really challenging but I love it.
I studied through Le wagon Bootcamp, and I'm so gratefull for all the knowledge that I have.
I can now say that I am a Junior Full stack developer, eager to learn more, work with many different people and discover new things through Code!
